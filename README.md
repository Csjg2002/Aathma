<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Aathma is a third-person, dark fantasy hack-and-slash 3D platformer focused thematically on grief and its overcoming.

Created as part of a live brief, I was the sole programmer for the game's development. This project presented a variety of unique challenges that pushed me to learn and implement new techniques. These included designing the sword melee combat system, which involved using animation notifies, as well as developing the time manipulation mechanics, which required working with timelines and custom time dilations.
